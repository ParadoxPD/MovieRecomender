 Movie Recommendation System Using Python

## Description

To build a Movie Recommendations with Movielens Dataset:
Almost everyone today uses technology to stream movies and television shows. While figuring out what to stream next can be daunting, recommendations are often made based on a viewerâ€™s history and preferences. This is done through machine learning and can be a fun and easy project for beginners to take on. New programmers can practice by coding in either Python or R languages and with data from the Movielens Dataset. Generated by more than 6,000 users, Movielens currently includes more than 1 million movie ratings of 3,900 films.

## Objective

- To be able to read the ```MovieLens Dataset``` and make sense of the data

- To convert the data into a *similarity* matrix

- To use that matrix to recommend movies to user based on a given movie using *item based filtering*

## Steps to run the project

- Download the [**Movielens Dataset**](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

- Change the **dataset_path** in the ```main.py``` file in the **src** directory to the path of your downloaded dataset.

- Run the ```main.py``` file in the terminal

        python main.py
