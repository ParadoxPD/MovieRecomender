 Movie Recommendation System Using Python

## Description

To build a Movie Recommendations with Movielens Dataset:
Almost everyone today uses technology to stream movies and television shows. While figuring out what to stream next can be daunting, recommendations are often made based on a viewerâ€™s history and preferences. This is done through machine learning and can be a fun and easy project for beginners to take on. New programmers can practice by coding in either Python or R languages and with data from the Movielens Dataset. Generated by more than 6,000 users, Movielens currently includes more than 1 million movie ratings of 3,900 films.
